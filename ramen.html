<h1>Ramen</h1>
<img scr="http://rasamalaysia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/misoramen3.jpg">
<p>
Hi, I'm ramen. You may remember me from such bowls as "First Dish I Learned to Cook On My Own," the ever-popular "Morning After Peach Schnapps-Fueled College Dorm Room Party," "Don't Tell Mom The Microwave Is Dead," or, one of my more subtle, emotional works, "Oriental Flavor."
<br>
<br>
Despite its popularity among the cash-strapped and the sodium-starved, the world or ramen extends far beyond the instant variety we grew up on. Originating in China, alkaline noodles served in soupy broth have been in Japan for well over a century, but like pizza in America, only became widespread after World War II. Troops returning from overseas had developed a taste for the stretchy noodles, and the inexpensive ingredients—wheat flour, bones, and vegetables—made them an attractive dish for restaurants to serve.
<br>
<br>
Nowadays, ramen is high in the running for national dish of Japan. Museums have opened dedicated to its history. The instant ramen noodle was voted as the greatest Japanese export of the 20th century in a national poll (placing ahead of karaoke machines, walkmen, and Kurosawa films). And, just as with pizza in the U.S., regional styles and specialties abound with soups, noodles, and toppings, all varied according to local tastes, ingredients, and cultures.
<br>

<h2>
Broth
</h2>
<p>
You often see ramen categorized into four classes: shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), miso (fermented bean paste), and tonkotsu (pork), which doesn't make particular sense, as the first three are flavorings, while the fourth is the broth base. It's sort of like saying "there are four basic types of pizza: Neapolitan, Sicilian, New York, and pepperoni."
<br>
<br>
While it's true that even in Japan, some folks see those four classes as distinct styles, there are plenty of cases where there are overlaps and outliers. For instance, what would you call a creamy, opaque, heavy ramen that's made entirely with chicken bones? It doesn't fall neatly into any of those categories, but it certainly exists.
<br>
<br>
Instead, it makes much more sense to categorize ramen broth first by its <b>heaviness</b>, then by the <b>soup base ingredients</b>, and finally by the <b>seasoning source</b>. This classification system, used by some Japanese sources, can be combined to cover pretty much every bowl of soup-based ramen in existence.
</p>
<h2>
Classification by Heaviness
</h2>
<img scr="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/2012/09/20120921-223365-bestofjapan-ramenstreet.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" margin="auto">
<p>
Heaviness is classified as either <i>kotteri</i> (rich) or <i>assari</i> (light). Kotteri broths will be thick, sticky, and usually opaque, packed with emulsified fats, minerals, and proteins from long-boiled bones. Opaque white bone broths are also known by their transliterated Chinese name, <i>paitan</i>. Assari broths are clear and thin, usually flavored with more vegetables, fish, or bones cooked relatively briefly at a light simmer so as not to cloud the broth.
</p>
<h2>
Classification by Broth Base
</h2>

<p>
The <b>broth base</b> is the main ingredients simmered to make the soup. This can range from animal bones—pork, chicken, beef, and fresh fish being the most common—to even lighter broths made with sea kelp or or dried seafood. In addition to their main ingredient, ramen broths incorporate a variety of aromatics, such as charred onions, garlic, ginger, fresh scallions or leeks, and mushrooms.

<p>
The most widely recognized and celebrated broth worldwide these days is <i>tonkotsu</i>, a boiled pork bone broth. The best tonkotsu broths are a milky, golden color and leave a sticky sheen of gelatin on your lips as you slurp them.
</p>
<h2>
Classification by Seasoning
</h2>
<p>
The <b>seasoning</b> is the main salt source used to flavor the soup. It can be mixed directly into the soup base, but in many ramen shops, it's added to each individual bowl, making the menu a bit more customizable. The most common seasonings are:
